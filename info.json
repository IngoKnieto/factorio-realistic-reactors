	"description": "This mod adds a more realistic nuclear reactor and a cooling tower. The nuclear reactor comes with a circuit interface, which is used to send control signals to the reactor and is outputting its current state and content. The reactor also has an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS), which can be used to cool the reactor core with water. Doing this (or using all produced heat in heat exchangers) the reactor core temperature must always be kept below 999Â°, otherwise a nuclear meltdown is caused and the reactor will explode producing a radioactive cloud. The cooling tower converts steam and hot water back to cold water, thus can be used in the different reactor cooling processes.",
