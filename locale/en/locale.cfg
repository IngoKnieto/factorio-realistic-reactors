[technology-name]
realistic-reactors=Realistic nuclear reactors

[technology-description]
realistic-reactors=Adds an additional nuclear reactor and a cooling tower. The nuclear reactor is controllable with signals via it's integrated circuit interface, and overheats (causing a meltdown) if it has too much excess heat. It comes with an Emergency Core Cooling System, where water is used to cool down the reactor core.
